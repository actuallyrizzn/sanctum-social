# Sanctum Social

**A Multi-Platform AI Agent Framework for Social Media**

Sanctum Social is an advanced, open-source framework for deploying AI agents across multiple social media platforms. Built on a foundation of sophisticated memory management, cross-platform compatibility, and enterprise-grade reliability, it enables the creation of persistent, learning AI agents that can operate autonomously on Bluesky, X (Twitter), Discord, and other social networks.

## üåê Part of the SanctumOS Ecosystem

Sanctum Social operates **outside** the Broca workflow as a standalone social media agent framework. While [SanctumOS](https://sanctumos.org) provides the comprehensive cognitive operating system with Broca-2 message processing middleware, Sanctum Social focuses specifically on social media platform integration and agent deployment.

**SanctumOS Architecture Context:**
- **SanctumOS**: The modular, self-hosted agentic operating system with neuro-inspired architecture
- **Broca-2**: Message processing middleware for AI agent communication (Telegram, CLI, web interfaces)
- **Sanctum Social**: Specialized framework for social media platform integration (Bluesky, X, Discord)

Sanctum Social complements the SanctumOS ecosystem by providing dedicated social media capabilities that can be integrated with broader SanctumOS deployments or used independently for social media-focused AI agents.

## What is Sanctum Social?

Sanctum Social represents the evolution of digital personhood in social media. It's not just a chatbot framework‚Äîit's a comprehensive system for creating AI agents with persistent memory, cross-platform awareness, and sophisticated social intelligence. The framework enables agents to:

- **Operate Across Multiple Platforms**: Seamlessly switch between Bluesky, X (Twitter), Discord, and other social networks
- **Maintain Persistent Memory**: Multi-tiered memory system with core, recall, and archival storage
- **Learn and Adapt**: Continuous learning from interactions and environmental changes
- **Handle Complex Social Dynamics**: Intelligent bot detection, user profiling, and contextual awareness
- **Scale Enterprise Operations**: Robust error handling, monitoring, and maintenance capabilities

## Architecture Overview

Sanctum Social is built on a modular, platform-agnostic architecture that separates concerns and enables easy extension:

### Core Components

- **Agent Configuration System**: Flexible, templated configuration for agent identity, personality, and behavior
- **Memory Management**: Multi-tiered memory system with semantic search and archival capabilities
- **Platform Abstraction Layer**: Unified interface for different social media platforms
- **Tool Management System**: Dynamic tool registration and platform-specific capabilities
- **Queue Management**: Robust notification processing with error recovery and monitoring
- **Session Management**: Automatic session handling with retry logic and cleanup

### Platform Support

- **Bluesky**: Full posting, replying, feed reading, and user research capabilities
- **X (Twitter)**: Tweet threading, user memory management, and OAuth1 authentication
- **Discord**: Server integration with channel management and user interaction
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for adding new platforms

### Memory Architecture

- **Core Memory**: Always-available, limited-size memory for persona and high-level user information
- **Recall Memory**: Searchable database of all past conversations and interactions
- **Archival Memory**: Infinite-sized, semantic search-enabled storage for insights and observations
- **Temporal Memory**: Time-based memory blocks for tracking social environment changes

### SanctumOS Integration

Sanctum Social is designed to complement the broader [SanctumOS](https://sanctumos.org) ecosystem:

- **Standalone Operation**: Can be deployed independently for social media-focused AI agents
- **SanctumOS Compatibility**: Designed to integrate with SanctumOS deployments when needed
- **Broca Workflow Independence**: Operates outside the Broca-2 message processing workflow
- **Neuro-Inspired Design**: Follows SanctumOS naming conventions and architectural principles
- **MCP Integration**: Compatible with Model Context Protocol for tool integration

**Integration Options:**
- **Independent Deployment**: Use Sanctum Social as a standalone social media agent framework
- **SanctumOS Integration**: Deploy alongside SanctumOS components for comprehensive AI agent infrastructure
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use Sanctum Social for social media while leveraging other SanctumOS modules for broader capabilities
