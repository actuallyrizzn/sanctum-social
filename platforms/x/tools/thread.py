    Add a single post to the current X reply thread. This tool indicates to the handler 
    that it should add this post to the ongoing reply thread context when responding to a mention.
    
    This is an atomic operation - each call adds exactly one post. The handler (x_bot.py or similar)
    manages the thread state and ensures proper threading when multiple posts are queued.

    Args:

    Raises:
        Exception: If text exceeds character limit. On failure, the post will be omitted 
                  from the reply thread and the agent may try again with corrected text.
