"""
Minimal reproducible example for Letta dynamic block loading issue.

This demonstrates the core problem:
1. A tool dynamically attaches a new block to an agent via the API
2. Memory functions (memory_insert, core_memory_replace) fail because the 
   agent's internal state (agent_state.memory) doesn't reflect the newly attached block
3. The error occurs because agent_state.memory.get_block() throws KeyError

The issue appears to be that agent_state is loaded once at the beginning of processing
a message and isn't refreshed after tools make changes via the API.

    print("""
1. Refresh agent_state after tool execution:
   - After each tool call, reload agent_state from the database
   - This ensures agent_state.memory reflects API changes
   
2. Update agent_state.memory directly in attach_user_blocks:
   - Instead of only using API, also update agent_state.memory.blocks
   - This keeps the in-memory state synchronized
   
3. Use a different approach for dynamic blocks:
   - Have memory functions check the API for block existence
   - Or use a lazy-loading approach for blocks
   
4. Make agent_state.memory aware of API changes:
   - Implement a mechanism to sync agent_state with database changes
   - Could use events or callbacks when blocks are attached/detached

The core issue is that agent_state is loaded once and becomes stale when
tools make changes via the API during message processing.
