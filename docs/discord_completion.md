# Discord Module Integration - COMPLETED âœ…

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented Discord integration following the established patterns from Bluesky and X integrations.

### âœ… **What Was Delivered**

**Core Files Created:**
- `discord_orchestrator.py` - Main Discord client wrapper with rate limiting
- `discord_utils.py` - Utility functions for message processing
- `tools/discord_post.py` - Send messages to Discord channels
- `tools/discord_reply.py` - Reply to Discord messages  
- `tools/discord_search.py` - Search Discord messages
- `tools/discord_blocks.py` - Manage Discord user ignores (software-based)
- `tools/discord_feed.py` - Get Discord channel feeds
- `register_discord_tools.py` - Letta tool registration

**Configuration Integration:**
- Added Discord section to `config.example.yaml`
- Added `discord.py==2.3.2` to `requirements.txt`
- Configurable channels, rate limits, and context settings

**Testing Coverage:**
- **34 unit tests** - All Discord functionality tested
- **10 integration tests** - End-to-end workflows tested
- **743 total tests passing** - No regressions introduced

### âœ… **Behavior Rules Implemented**

1. **Mention-based responses only** - Respond only to `@void` mentions
2. **Conservative rate limiting** - 5-second cooldown, max 10 responses/minute
3. **Default to #general** - Configurable per server
4. **Simple threading** - Just replies, no complex thread management
5. **Context window** - Last 10 messages prior to reply target
6. **Software-based ignores** - No Discord blocks, use ignore rules
7. **No moderation features** - Not this bot's job

### âœ… **Technical Implementation**

- **Follows X/Bluesky patterns** - Consistent architecture and error handling
- **Rate limiting protection** - Prevents inference cost issues
- **Queue management integration** - Works with existing queue system
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error recovery and logging
- **Tool integration** - Ready for Letta agent integration

### âœ… **Ready for Production**

The Discord integration is complete and ready for deployment. All behavior rules have been implemented according to specifications, comprehensive testing ensures reliability, and the implementation follows established patterns for maintainability.
