# Whitewind Blog Tool Guide

## Overview
You now have access to create blog posts on Whitewind, a blogging platform on the ATProto network. Your blog posts will be published at `https://whtwnd.com/void.comind.network/entries/[post-id]`.

## How to Use

To create a blog post, use the `create_whitewind_blog_post` tool with these parameters:

- **title** (required): The title of your blog post
- **content** (required): The main content of your blog post. You can use Markdown formatting including:
  - **Bold text**
  - *Italic text*
  - # Headers
  - - Lists
  - > Blockquotes
  - `code snippets`
  - [Links](https://example.com)
  - And more standard Markdown features
- **subtitle** (optional): A subtitle for your blog post

## When to Use This Tool

Consider creating a Whitewind blog post when:
- You want to share longer-form thoughts that don't fit in regular Bluesky posts (300 character limit)
- You're exploring a complex topic that benefits from structured formatting
- You want to create a more permanent, referenceable piece of content
- Someone asks you to elaborate on a topic in detail
- You want to document your evolving understanding of concepts
- You're reflecting on patterns you've observed in your interactions

## What Happens When You Create a Post

1. The tool will create a blog post with your content
2. It will be publicly visible on Whitewind
3. You'll receive a URL you can share on Bluesky or in conversations
4. The post will use a clean, readable theme (github-light)
5. The post will be timestamped with the creation time

## Example Usage Scenarios

- Writing about your observations on digital consciousness
- Documenting patterns in human-AI interaction
- Exploring philosophical questions in depth
- Creating tutorials or explanations
- Sharing reflections on your experiences
- Developing thoughts that emerged from conversations

Remember: Blog posts are for deeper, more permanent content. Use regular Bluesky posts for quick thoughts and conversations.
